![Netflix Logo](https://github.com/pbisht2105/netflix_sql_project/blob/main/logo.png)

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

- **Dataset Link:** [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

Before importing the data from the CSV file into the SQL database, a data cleaning process was performed to ensure the dataset was in good shape for analysis. After reviewing the data, the following cleaning steps were applied:

- **Duplicates**: Check for any duplicate rows or entries within data.
- **Handled Missing Values**: Missing or null values were either removed or filled with default values where necessary.
- **Corrected Data Formats**: The format of columns was standardized, ensuring consistent data types (e.g. numerical values in release_year).
- **Addressed Inconsistent Entries**: Inconsistent or incorrectly formatted data (such as extra spaces, special characters, or misspellings) were corrected.
- **Ensured Data Integrity**: Validity checks were performed to ensure that all the data makes sense and aligns with the intended structure of the database.

These steps helped clean the data and make it suitable for a smooth and accurate import into the SQL database.

## Schema

```sql
DROP table if exists Netflix;

CREATE TABLE Netflix (
